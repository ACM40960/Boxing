    "### Results Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validation Accuracy\n",
    "    - Achieved a **best validation accuracy of 99.62%** (epoch 47).\n",
    "    - Accuracy steadily increased from ~97% (epoch 1) to ~99.6% by later epochs.\n",
    "    - Indicates the model consistently learned the class patterns with minimal error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classification Report\n",
    "    - **Precision, Recall, F1-score ≈ 1.00** for all four classes: cross, jab, hook, uppercut.\n",
    "    - Implies the model is nearly perfect in distinguishing between all punch types.\n",
    "    - Macro and weighted averages also = 1.00 - balanced and consistent performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Confusion Matrix\n",
    "    - Predictions are almost entirely correct.\n",
    "    - Out of **3200 samples per class**, only a handful misclassified:\n",
    "        - Cross: 17 misclassified (mostly as hook).\n",
    "        - Jab: 9 misclassified.\n",
    "        - Hook: 21 misclassified (some as cross).\n",
    "        - Uppercut: only 1 misclassified.\n",
    "    - Shows very low confusion across classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROC Curves\n",
    "    - All four classes have **AUC = 1.00**.\n",
    "    - ROC curves hug the top-left corner → model separates classes with near-perfect confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall Observation\n",
    "    - The model demonstrates **extremely high accuracy and robustness** across all metrics.\n",
    "    - Errors are negligible, with near-perfect per-class separation.\n",
    "    - Suggests the dataset is highly learnable, and the LSTM effectively captures temporal pose dynamics."
